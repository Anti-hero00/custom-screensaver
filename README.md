custom-screensaver
==================

The only changes I made was to link directly to a png in what I believe is the default path and made it resize to whatever the image is. 
I did get another dvd logo and cleaned it up as the old one wasn't too great

to add a custom image once you have the original app installed is to use [WebOS Dev Manager](https://github.com/webosbrew/dev-manager-desktop) to connect or whatever method you prefer and go to /media/developer/apps/usr/palm/applications/org.webosbrew.custom-screensaver/assets and then upload 300.png and screensaver-main.qml. 
The custom image you want to use has to be like the original where the black is transparent and where it's transparent changes colours.

The image size I would recommend is probably not too much bigger than 300X300 but it's up to you if you want to test something massive lol
